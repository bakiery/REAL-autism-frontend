            ## AI Facial Assessment Tool

    This tool is designed to provide information about facial features associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Please follow the instructions below to use the tool effectively:

    1. Upload a photo: Click on the "Upload Photo" button to select and upload a photo of the individual whose facial features you would like to analyze.

    2. Analyze facial features: Once the photo is uploaded, the tool will analyze the facial features based on research findings related to ASD. The analysis may take a few moments.

    3. Interpretation: After the analysis is complete, the tool will provide you with the likelihood of the child having autism based on their facial landmarks, compared against faces from the trained datasets of other autistic and non-autistic children's faces. Please remember that this tool is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a diagnostic tool. A formal diagnosis of autism should be made by a qualified healthcare professional.

    Interpretation of Scores:
    - Score below 0.3: Indicates a lower likelihood of ASD-related facial features.
    - Score between 0.3 and 0.7: Suggests a moderate likelihood of ASD-related facial features.
    - Score above 0.7: Indicates a higher likelihood of ASD-related facial features.

    ## Understanding Facial Features Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
    Recent studies have identified certain facial features that are commonly observed in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These features include a broader top face, a shorter midface, eyes with a wider palpebral fissure length (PFL) and interpupillary distance (IPD), a wider mouth, and a shorter and wider philtrum (the groove between the nose and top lip)[1].

    Moreover, there are suggestions from other sources that indicate a potential association between ASD and other features such as larger lips and small tufting in spots at the hairline. However, it's important to note that these features are not universally present in individuals with autism and require further verification through additional research.

    Baron-Cohenâ€™s extreme male brain theory proposes that autism results from elevated prenatal testosterone levels. In a separate study [2] on adult morphology and facial features associated with masculinity, researchers created composite images capturing statistical regularities in facial appearance linked to high and low Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores. However, given the lack of available, verificable data, this model has not been trained on autistic adult faces.

    It's worth mentioning that these facial features associated with autism are generally subtle and may not be noticeably distinct to the average observer. Additionally, the presence of these features can vary within the autistic population, as autism itself encompasses a range of characteristics.
